We are a well-coordinated team that brings together expertise in geography and computer science to solve your problems in a technically correct and efficient manner. Our advisors support us with expertise in environmental and climate research, remote sensing, modeling, and the Internet of Things.

The vision of the Geo Engine team is to integrate geodata and time series into analyses and business processes in an uncomplicated way. We use our own **Geo Engine** platform, which connects a wide range of data sources, delivers robust processing, and provides many interfaces. The use cases in companies are therefore diverse: as a web UI and via a Python library for data scientists, as an API for process integration, and as reports for decision-makers.

## Innovation on a robust foundation

The cornerstone of the Geo Engine was laid in the Database Systems working group at the Philipps University of Marburg. Prof. Bernhard Seeger did pioneering work in geodata processing here and gained international renown. In 2013, Christian Beilschmidt, Johannes Drönner, and Michael Mattig joined the team to implement the more comprehensive vision of a virtual research environment for geodata with the VAT system – the precursor to the Geo Engine.

In 2020, the concept was developed to further develop the system from a research prototype to a system for all user levels ([Geo Engine to solve mountains of data (German)](https://www.op-marburg.de/Marburg/Geo-Engine-soll-dazu-beitragen-Datenberge-zu-meistern)). This development was funded by BMWK’s EXIST research transfer program with a sum of €700,000 ([Mastering the complexity of geodata (German)](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/aktuelles/news/2020/die-komplexitaet-von-geodaten-meistern)), and Geo Engine GmbH was founded in July 2021. Since then, there have been exciting areas of application (see [references](/en/examples-references/) & [Satellite data supports small-scale farming in Africa (German)](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/aktuelles/news/2023/satellitendaten-unterstuetzen-anbau)), new funding pots such as the ESA Business Incubator, and new projects in which the Geo Engine as a system and our team are in use.
