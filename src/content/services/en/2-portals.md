We create custom-fit data portals with and for you.
This allows you to offer dynamic data and interactive analyses for your target group.
Web GIS, dashboards and Jupyter notebooks are then possible as a form of access, depending on the target group and area of application.
The data portal can also offer derived data, because with Geo Engine we bring a tool with standard interfaces and workflow processing.
