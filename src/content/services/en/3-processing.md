We realize data and AI pipelines for you.
We define comprehensible workflows and implement them as robust, reusable and repeatable data processing.
Our motto here is “workflows instead of scripts”, which can implement complex processing pipelines while being directly operationalizable.
By using our Geo Engine technology, even updated data can be processed directly.
Through Geo Engine’s workflow approach, we can implement the dynamic AI pipelines that are right for you.
In doing so, you can benefit from all the advantages of Geo Engine: Your AI pipeline reacts to updated data, can be adapted to new target regions and times without effort and is flexibly expandable.
