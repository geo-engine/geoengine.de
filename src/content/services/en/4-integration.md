We integrate and combine your internal geodata for you and provide you with access to external data pools. We realize this in the form of a data mesh, so that the respective specialist teams can access a wide variety of data sources in a uniform and transparent manner.
The previously time-consuming data preparation can thus be largely eliminated.
This saves your teams a lot of time, which they can use for their technical work.
Our data mesh solution offers many more advantages: From now on, all geodata are dynamic time series.
For example, external satellite data can be integrated so that the most up-to-date data is always available.
Examples of external data are Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 LAI, ECMWF ERA5, SRTM, MODIS, ALOS PALSAR and ECOSCTRESS.
