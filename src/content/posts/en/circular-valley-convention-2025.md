Efficient regulation and a sustainable economy are not mutually exclusive. The current focus on reducing bureaucracy is important to enable innovation and streamline processes. At the same time, we must ensure that we do not lose sight of sustainability goals.

At the Circular Valley Convention 2025 in Düsseldorf, precisely these challenges will be discussed and new solutions presented. With Geo Engine GmbH, we support companies in making data-driven decisions that are both economically viable and ecologically sound.
Smart, balanced solutions are needed – and it is precisely these that are created through dialog between business, politics and science.
