The EBV Analyzer is an interactive data portal for essential biodiversity variables. Here we have implemented, from existing Geo Engine building blocks, a data portal that is easy to use for biodiversity researchers and policy stakeholders. In a co-design process with the experts from GEO BON we developed visualization, analysis but also the integration of the complex EBV time series data.

## Highlights

- Integration of various EBV datasets
- Development of an adapter for GEO-BON specific EBV data formats
- Indexing of data & data time series

## Methodology

GEO BON provides important biodiversity data in an interactive and easy-to-use web portal. Based on our toolbox, we implemented the interactive portal in this project suitable for biodiversity researchers and stakeholders from politics. Thus, we created the possibility to easily visualize the available time series data and to be able to analyze them for individual countries. The challenge was to directly integrate heterogeneous data from different researchers worldwide and make it globally available. We implemented an adapter for the Geo Engine for the specific EBV-4D data schema of GEO BON with multiple variables and time series. In addition, to enable interactive operation, the data is automatically indexed and made available. We seamlessly integrated the portal into the existing data environment.
