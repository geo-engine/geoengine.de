title: GdO dragonfly portal for NFDI4Biodiversity
---

We developed an interactive data portal for the German dragonfly research community. In a co-design process with the experts, we developed the presentation of dragonfly observation data as well as interactive analyses.

## Highlights

- Built from existing building blocks (Geo Engine UI)
- Easy-to-use data portal with domain-specific functions
- Connection of data sets in GeoPackage and GeoTiff format

## Methodik

We developed a data portal for NFDI4Biodiversity that is easy to use for dragonfly experts and provides analyses of preferences regarding temperatures, precipitation and proximity to water bodies per dragonfly species. Based on existing Geo Engine building blocks, we created a target group oriented web based application. Invisible to users, the infrastructure runs in the cloud. The data is also loaded from the appropriate data infrastructures in the cloud. For NFDI4Biodiversityâ€™s own data lake, which provides a data infrastructure for biodiversity data, a matching data access was implemented, which is reusable. The goal of the project is to be able to provide interactive data portals quickly and easily for a wide range of specialist communities. Based on the developed portal, any other subject data portals can now be created very quickly thanks to our modular approach. As part of the project, we have written and published a scientific paper on the topic (https://doi.org/10.18420/BTW2023-55).
